     Service account 12340005-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com does not have enough permissions

     Service account 12340005-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com does not have enough permissions
   - gcpdiag-dataproc1-aaaa/us-central1/test-best-practices-enabled       [ OK ]

   VM Service Account should have required permissions to function correctly.
   Though required permission may be granted via user-managed role or primitive
   roles, it is recommended to grant roles/dataproc.worker on project level.
