"""GKE cluster size close to maximum allowed by pod range

The maximum amount of nodes in a GKE cluster is limited based on its pod CIDR
range. This test checks if the cluster is approaching the maximum amount of
nodes allowed by the pod range. Users may end up blocked in production if they
are not able to scale their cluster due to this hard limit imposed by the pod
CIDR.
