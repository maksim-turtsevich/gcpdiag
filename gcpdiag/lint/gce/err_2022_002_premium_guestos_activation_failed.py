"""Serial logs don't contain Guest OS activation errors

Premium Guest OSes need to activate their license when created and
refreshed regularly after activation. In an event that guest OS cannot
communicate with the license servers, the messages:
"Could not contact activation server." /
"Server needs to be activated by a KMS Server" /
"Exiting without registration" in the serial output would
indicate license activation failures.
